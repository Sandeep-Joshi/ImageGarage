# ImageGarage

It is a simple image hosting website built on MS Azure services as a class coursework.  
See images **Demo #.jpg** in the root.

Since this project evolved as we learned more Azure topics in the class I have kept separate branches as different checkpoints.  

Branches:  
**Oauth**: Locally hosted using Windows filesystem, MySQL(local) and Azure simulator. Added Oauth and 3rd party sign-ons.  
**Azure_storage_enabled**: Using Azure container for storing images (blobs), Azure tables (image logs), Azure queues (notifications), and Azure MySql for db.  
**Azure**: Final culmination of Project into a Webserver and web worker roles. Imploying Azure service bus.

PS:  
I've removed all my credentials from the config files. The project will not work until you add working credentials.   
If you find any credentials in the code/config, please inform me.
